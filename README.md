# README

Hello and welcome to the Github for my portfolio site! This site was made in a bit of an "overkill" fashion. I've made the site as a Rails app for the practice in taking existing code (my original site) and translating it into a Rails app, deploying to Heroku, as well as how to alias the URL. This was a fun project that I really enjoyed creating and it was great to stretch my creative muscles. Please let me know if you have any feedback for me!

My site includes:

* Ruby on Rails 

* HTML

* CSS

* Bootstrap

* Javascript

There are a few poorly hidden Easter Eggs. **hint** font awesome
